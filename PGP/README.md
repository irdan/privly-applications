# PGP

**=== THIS IS PRE-ALPHA SOFTWARE - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ====**

The PGP application allows multiple parties to communicate through PGP
(Pretty Good Privacy) encryption in Privly. PGP keys are generated by
[OpenPGP.js](http://openpgpjs.org) and public keys are uploaded to a
Directory Provider. Identities are verified through the use of [Mozilla
Persona](https://persona.org). The primary focus is to provide user
friendly PGP encryption.

### Remote Resources
There are 3 remote resources involved in this application:

  *  **Directory Provider:** Provides a remote key-value store for public
     keys and their associated backed identity assertion.
  *  **Remote Verifier:** Authenticates the backed identity assertion
     associated with an email address and public key. Long term the
     intent is to run a verifier locally in the browser.
  *  **Content Server:** Provides a location for message storage and
     retrieval. Note that the content server only stores the ciphertext
     of messagesr, private keys are created locally, and private keys
     never leave the browser.

For more details on the protocol for this app, see the
[protocol](PROTOCOL.md) document.

### Current Status

Currently the app supports basic encryption/decryption of content posted and
retrieved from a content server. This is currently done with keys read from
localforage. Key management is currently being implemented.

Tests are written for OpenPGP.js in the Privly context that confirm correctness
of the encryption, key generation, and signing and verification of encrypted
messages. Basic tests for the personapgp functions are outlined but not
implemented.

Note that the verifyPubKey function in pgp/js/personapgp.js is not currently
performing the actions that it should.  Currently, it just returns true instead
of performing any verification. This is because the generation of backed
identity assertions is not yet mature.  A good reminder as to why this software
is PRE-ALPHA status.

### Current TODO
- Sign and encrypt messages (currently the app just encrypts without
      signing)
- Verify signatures when decrypting messages
- Generate a backed identity assertions in browser
- Sign a PersonaPGP key with the public key found in a backed identity
      assertion
- Verify a returned back identity assertion and signature
- Implement tests that are already outlined


### Storage
Storage of keys is handled using
[localForage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage). This is because local
Storage is not currently supported across all browsers and platforms.
localForage acts as a shim that provides support on [all
platforms](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/02/localforage-offline-storage-improved/).

The data that is stored in localforage is of two types. Your own keypairs, and
the public keys of your contacts.

```
{
  my_keypairs: { email: [keypairs]    },
  my_contacts: { email: [public keys] }
}
```

In other words, localforage is a hash with two entries, `my_contacts` and
`my_keypairs`.  Both entires have values that are a hash where emails are keys
with a corresponding value of an array of public keys or keypairs,
respectively. In the case of your keypairs, the key is naturally your own
email.


### Getting Started with Development

To get started developing the PGP app in chrome:

1.  Clone the repositories with ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/privly/privly-chrome.git```.
1.  run ```cd privly-chrome``` to switch into the privly-chrome folder.
1.  Change the branch in privly-chrome to expiremental-apps with
    ```git checkout expiremental-apps```.
1.  run ```cd privly-applications``` to switch into the privly-applications folder.
1.  Change the branch in privly-applications to expiremental-pgp with
    ```git checkout expiremental-pgp```.
1.  In chrome on the extensions page, check the 'Developer mode' box.
1.  Click load unpacked extension and load your privly-chrome folder.
